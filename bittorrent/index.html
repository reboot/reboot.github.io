<P><B>BitTorrent IPv6 Client</B></P>
<P align="justify">
Because I could not find any Peer2Peer Software that supports IPv6
I decided to see if I could add support for it to one of the
existing protocols. Adding this support BitTorrent seemed to be 
easy, because the protocol does not make any restrictions what is
transfers as the peer IP address. and I started to work on it.

<P align="justify">
After 2 days the result is an IPv6 enabled BitTorrent peer client
and tracker. You can download it from this page. For IPv6 support
python2.3 is required.<BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
IPv6 support is available for the tracker and the peers.

<B>IPv6 enabled Tracker:</B><BR>
The tracker will accept IPv4 and IPv6 connections (if not
bound to a specific address with --bind). The type of
connection the peer makes to the tracker decides with type
of IP is used in the peer list. Peers connecting through
IPv4 connections will be listed with IPv4 address, IPv6
connecting peers with IPv6, if they do not specify a
different address with --ip.
</P>
<P align="justify">
<B>IPv6 enabled Peer Client:</B><BR>
The client can connect to IPv6 and IPv4 peers without
problems.
</P>
<P align="justify">
The type of connections to the peer depend on the type of
address that is listed in the peer list from the tracker.
<UL>
    <LI>
	If the peer is listed with IPv4 (either because it
	connected to the tracker by IPv4 or used the --ip switch
	with an IPv4) it will work like before (if not bound to
	an IPv6 adress with --bind, what makes no sense).
    </LI>
    <LI>
	If the peer ist listed with IPv6 (as above IPv6   
	connection to tracker or --ip switch with IPv6) it only   
	other IPv6 clients can make connections to it. The peer   
        itself can still connect to other IPv4 clients, so it will  
        perform like a firewalled client to IPv4 only peers. Even if
        you do not have a IPv6 connection to the tracker you can use
        the --ip switch to force your IPv6 address in the peer list
        and IPv6 peers can communite over IPv6 when the tracker does
        not support IPv6.
    </LI>
    <LI>
	If the peer is listed with a domain name (with --ip
        switch) peers should be able to connect with every IP
        address associated with the domain name. So if the domain
        has a A and AAAA entry IPv6 peers can connect via IPv6 and
        IPv4 clients with IPv4.
